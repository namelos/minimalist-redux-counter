## A Minimalist Counter Example with React and Redux

Simple counter example showing how redux works more clearly.

#### run:

```
npm start

ES6 tips:

`param => val` equals to `function(param) { return val }`

While there is no need for return statement, you have to return an expression which has a value like: `({ foo: bar })` instead of raw objects: `{ foo: bar }`

`{ foo, bar }` equals to `{ foo: foo, bar: bar }`
